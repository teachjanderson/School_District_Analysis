# PyCity School District Analysis

# Overview and Purpose
The PyCity School district requested an analysis of recent testing data to look at performance trends and patterns. These inform decisions at the school and district level. This analysis investigated student funding and test scores in the area of reading and mathematics for grades 9-12. Due to evidence of academic dishonesty for 9th graders at Thomas High School, the school board requested a review of the data. This included replacing scores for Thomas High School with Nans, while keeping the remaining data, and reporting how this change impacted the overall analysis.
